**Introducing WitherHub - Elevate Your Experience!** ðŸ“¢

I am thrilled to announce the launch of **WitherHub**, a powerful and feature-rich script meticulously crafted by me, **R.O.D**!

To get started, you can load WitherHub using:
`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lifelessrose/WitherHub/refs/heads/main/WitherHub.lua"))()`

WitherHub (GUI titled "Witherhub by R.O.D") is designed to enhance your client-side experience with a versatile suite of tools and unique customization options.

ðŸ”‘ **Accessing WitherHub - Important Steps:** ðŸ”‘

1.  **Step 1: Load the Script**
    * Use the loadstring: `loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lifelessrose/WitherHub/refs/heads/main/WitherHub.lua"))()`

2.  **Step 2: Key Redemption**
    * A UI will appear. You will first need a valid key to activate the WitherHub interface. One of the current keys you can use is: `u7gY7u3OjUvERj0Qq2ZQ`
    * (Other keys may be available - contact R.O.D for information.)

3.  **Step 3: Username Whitelisting by R.O.D (CRUCIAL FOR FEATURE ACCESS)**
    * After successfully redeeming a key, you **MUST** contact me, **R.O.D (the script owner)**, and provide your **exact Roblox username**.
    * I will then add your username to the official WitherHub whitelist.
    * **Please note: Access to WitherHub's features is only granted AFTER your username has been whitelisted by me. Simply having a key is not enough to use the features.**

4.  **Step 4: Open the WitherHub GUI**
    * Once you have successfully executed the script, passed key validation, and been whitelisted by R.O.D, look for a small button labeled **"WitherHub"** on your screen (usually found in the **top-left corner**).
    * **Click this "WitherHub" button to open the main script interface.**
    * Alternatively, you can type `;gui` in the chat to toggle the GUI.

*Exclusive Perk for Staff:* As the Owner, I, along with designated Co-Owners, enjoy an automatic bypass of the key entry step and are pre-whitelisted for all features!

WitherHub is a **client-side script**, meaning its primary effects enhance your individual game experience. Features like the time of day change are visual only for you. The special nametags will be visible on designated players if you and others are using WitherHub with the same role configurations.

Get ready for a new level of control and customization!
